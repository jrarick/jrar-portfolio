I created Longhorn Design Studio for my web consulting business. It was built with Next.js 15's new app router and used MDX to power the blog portion of it. Since it's just me for now I opted to go with something simple rather than a more robust content authoring setup with a CMS that would be take effort to maintain.

I used Adobe Illustrator to create the website logo and settled on using a dusty yellow as the primary brand color. The hue is reminiscent of an aged newspaper from the wild west era. I used [Motion](https://motion.dev/) to power the animations on the site and used [Lenis](https://lenis.darkroom.engineering/) for smooth scrolling.

## Animations are hard to get right

It takes a lot of tweaking to get the easing, duration, and delays just right. I found myself constantly adjusting these values to achieve the desired effects. It's a delicate balance between making the animations feel smooth and delightful but also making sure they don't distract from the content.
