description: "A Next.js marketing site/blog leveraging MDX and (Framer) Motion"

I created Longhorn Design Studio for my web consulting business. It was built with Next.js 15's new app router and used MDX to power the blog portion of it. Since it's just me for now I opted to go with something simple rather than a more robust content authoring setup with a CMS that would be take effort to maintain.

I used Adobe Illustrator to create the website logo and settled on using a dusty yellow as the primary brand color. The hue is reminiscent of an aged newspaper from the wild west era. I used [Motion](https://motion.dev/) to power the animations on the site and used [Lenis](https://lenis.darkroom.engineering/) for smooth scrolling to give it that high-end agency feel.
