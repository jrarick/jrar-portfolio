I implemented the user interface for Setpoint's Data Standardization Suite, a comprehensive platform that automates the complex data wrangling process for asset-backed finance companies. This products addresses the pain points that borrowers and lenders face when dealing with inconsistent data formats, manual validation processes, and time-consuming data transformation workflows.

## The Challenge

In asset-backed finance, data chaos is a persistent problem. Borrowers constantly juggle different data tape formats for each lender, spending countless hours mapping and cleaning data to meet credit agreement terms. Lenders, on the other hand, must validate, aggregate, and normalize data across multiple borrower facilities to get a clear view of portfolio performance. This manual, error-prone process delays funding decisions and introduces unnecessary operational risk.

## Building a Streamlined Solution

The Data Standardization Suite I contributed to provides an intuitive interface for an automated process:

### 1. Import Interface

New upload workflows that accommodate raw data sources including Excel files. The interface guides users through batch uploads while providing progress indicators and file validation feedback.

### 2. Real-time Validation Dashboard

The validation interface displays comprehensive data quality checks in real-time, flagging missing fields, inconsistencies, and errors with clear visual indicators. Users can quickly identify and address data issues before they impact downstream processes.

### 3. Centralized Data Warehouse

The final component is a comprehensive dashboard for accessing standardized data stored in Setpoint's data warehouse. This interface supports easy reporting, funding requests, and portfolio analytics with customizable views and export capabilities.

## Impact on the Industry

This product transforms how asset-backed finance companies handle data standardization. By replacing hours of manual spreadsheet work with an automated, auditable process, the UI enables faster funding decisions, cleaner portfolio reporting, and stronger risk management. It prioritizes efficiency and data quality, giving both borrowers and lenders the tools they need to move faster and make more confident decisions.
