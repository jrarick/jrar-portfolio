After six years in the industry, I've worn a number of different hats. From:

- influencing architecture and establishing best practices
- diagnosing and solving performance issues
- designing and developing website templates
- automating workflows to assist non-technical teams
- advocating for accessibility

Where I really find myself _most_ comfortable is at the intersection of design, frontend implementation, and user experience. Building things that are inspiring, meaningful, useful, and beautiful is what drives me. After all, we build software for humans so humans should be at the center.

I'm currently open to new opportunities; if you'd like to change that, [reach out](mailto:rarick.joshua.e@gmail.com)!
